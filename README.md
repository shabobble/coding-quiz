# Coding Quiz

Fourth week's homework for UNH Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp

## Description 

The goal of this project was to create a quiz app on JavaScript fundamentals from scratch that stores high scores. Our main tasks were to ensure that:

* Clicking the 'Start Quiz' button presents the first question and starts a timer

* Answering a question progresses the quiz to the next question 

* Answering a question incorrectly subtracts time from the quiz timer

* The quiz ends when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0

* The user is able to enter their initials at the end of the quiz to save their score in local storage

## Built with

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
